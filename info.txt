I have worked as a backend developer for creating REST API based based systems and worked with front-end integration for MEAN stack apps. For developing apps with a decoupled architecture. I have focused on security and performance to improve response time. I am well versed in Python, NodeJS and related tools like redis for building and maintaining a scalable architecture. I also have deployed production ready apps used by hundreds of people using AWS EC2, S3 and other cloud based tools. I frequently contribute to open source and support open source tools by creating issues, PRs for tools that I use frequently to try and give back to the community.
